A "light-mode" CSS implementation designed to override the default dark theme of the [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) learning platform. This repository serves as a visual demonstration, showcasing a clear "before" (boot.dev's default dark mode) and "after" (applied light mode) scenario, highlighting how custom styles can dramatically transform a web application's appearance to suit personal preferences.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This section will guide you through applying this custom CSS to your boot.dev experience using a browser extension.

### Prerequisites

*   A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, etc.)
*   A browser extension capable of applying custom CSS to websites. **Stylus** is highly recommended for its ease of use and management.

### Installation

1.  **Install the Stylus browser extension:**
    If you don't already have it, install Stylus for your browser:
    *   Chrome Web Store (Stylus)
    *   Firefox Add-ons (Stylus)
    *   *(Search for "Stylus" in your browser's extension/add-on store if using a different browser).*

2.  **Copy the CSS Code:**
    Navigate to the `styles/boot-dev-light-mode.css` file in this repository. Click on the file, then click the "Raw" button to view the plain text. Copy the entire content of this CSS file.

3.  **Apply with Stylus extension:**
    *   Go to the [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) website in your browser.
    *   Click on the **Stylus icon** in your browser's toolbar (it usually looks like an 'S' or a pencil).
    *   Select the option "Write style for: boot.dev" or "Create new style for boot.dev".
    *   A new tab or window will open with the Stylus editor. Paste the copied CSS content into the editor.
    *   Ensure the "Applies to" section is correctly set for `URLs on the domain` `boot.dev`.
    *   Give your style a descriptive name (e.g., "Boot.dev Light Mode").
    *   Click the **Save** button (usually on the left side).

Once saved, the light mode theme should be immediately applied to boot.dev!

## ‚ú® Visual Demonstration

See the dramatic difference this light-mode CSS makes to the boot.dev platform.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Custom Light Mode (Styled)

This image illustrates the same boot.dev interface after applying the `boot-dev-light-mode.css` file, transforming it into a bright, easy-on-the-eyes light theme.

## üí° How the Stylesheet Was Created (Prompting Files)

The `styles/boot-dev-light-mode.css` file was generated with the assistance of a large language model (LLM). The `prompts/` directory contains the specific input files and instructions (prompts) that were given to the LLM to generate the CSS. This includes:

*   **Initial requirements/goals:** Describing the desired light mode appearance.
*   **Contextual information:** Details about the boot.dev platform's structure or existing styles (if provided).
*   **Iterative refinements:** Subsequent prompts used to refine, debug, or expand upon the initial CSS output.

Exploring the `prompts/` directory can offer insight into the prompt engineering process used to achieve the current stylesheet.
